### Wargame ###

A wargame is a game in which an environment is setup so you can learn and test your skills. The progression is sequential, you have to find your way through each steps and difficulty is going up as you move on.Here you start with a given user account and you have to either find the password of next level/user or directly by gaining his privileges.

This project was used for a dojo series around linux, shell and some security advices. Idea was for beginners to start learning and using these platforms and sensibilize them to security from sysadmin and developper points of view.

* Exemple: `ssh -p 4242 pinky0@localhost`
